## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out an advice generator app using the Advice Slip API and get it looking as close to the design as possible. NOTE: This app works better in Chrome. Please wait at least 2 seconds before trying to generate a new piece of advice for the app to work properly.

Users should be able to:

- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
- The construction of my project was done with React js
